# Changelog

## [0.0.7] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Descriptors can be loaded into the current session and used for PSBT/address matching; explicit flash/SD save/load remains available for backups.
- Session descriptor actions are now descriptor-scoped: view, export QR, save to flash/SD, or remove from session after selecting the descriptor.
- Permissive signing mode (opt-in in settings): allows signing PSBTs whose key paths are not matched by any loaded session descriptor.
- PSBT review now shows signing policy, per-source input totals, and highlights external inputs in the Sankey diagram.
- Public key export now supports script type and account selection, plus BIP48 multisig cosigner xpub export.
- Support for Waveshare ESP32-P4-WiFi6-Touch-LCD-4.3 (wave_43, 480x800 MIPI DSI, ST7701)
- Simulator webcam capture is available on macOS and Linux.

### Changed
- Removed the policy-selection step from the signing flow. Any BIP-44/49/84/86 account that matches a whitelisted descriptor is accepted directly.
- Account derivation is now inferred from the PSBT key path rather than a manual user setting. Existing PSBTs continue to sign correctly.
- Descriptor registration is disabled until encrypted descriptor backups are available; loaded descriptors are session-only, while explicit flash/SD storage remains a backup/import feature.
- Session descriptor details now use a full-screen viewer for long descriptor text instead of a modal dialog.
- Battery status is shown with icon glyphs instead of text percentages.
- Updated project target to ESP-IDF v6.0.1.

### Fixed
- Descriptor duplicate detection catches equivalent QR/storage loads that differ only by checksum or hardened-path notation.
- Descriptor loads with the wrong network now report a network mismatch instead of a generic parse error.
- Encrypted descriptor backups loaded from storage return cleanly after confirmation.
- Wallet settings apply network and passphrase changes immediately.
- Address and PSBT review controls fit better on narrow screens, including wrapped policy chips and scaled Sankey diagrams.
- Avoid VFS slot exhaustion when reinitializing camera/storage paths.

### Migration notes
- Devices upgrading in-place have their legacy `def_pol` NVS key (the old default-wallet-policy setting) automatically erased on first boot. No user action required.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Address scan: progress dialog during sweep; per-round batch raised from 50 to 100
- Compact keypad layout on wave_35
- `just`: isolated per-board build dirs (`build_<board>/`); new `submodules` command
- CI runs on every commit of a PR

### Fixed
- Camera luminance pulsing (disable ESP32-P4 ISP AE loop; widen OV5647 stable band)
- Scanner settings overlay caused white flashes on wave_5
- Focus-motor V4L2 probe spammed logs on boards without DW9714
- Splash screen artifact on warm reset (stale framebuffer)
- Wallet settings: Apply button cropped; pending edits preserved across descriptor manager trip
- PIN error modal disappearing on mismatch / wrong PIN
- PIN anti-phishing reveal hidden behind keyboard on wave_35; now requires explicit Continue
- Derivation path parser rejects `H` as hardened marker

## [0.0.5] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Support for Waveshare ESP32-P4-WiFi6-Touch-LCD-5 (wave_5, 720x1280 MIPI DSI)

### Changed
- Updated k_quirc submodule
- Mnemonic storage: show name/ID after saving; larger delete button

### Fixed
- Entropy capture camera preview too zoomed in on small displays; uses PPA downscale instead of center crop
- KEF encrypt strength label overlapping keypad on wave_35

## [0.0.4] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- Scanner PPA Q4.4 quantization
- Screen rotation, not working with lgvl_adapter, was removed
- Dice rolls label overflowing the keypad on wave_35; truncates with "..." indicator when full

## [0.0.3] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Multi-device support: Waveshare ESP32-P4-WiFi6-Touch-LCD-3.5 (wave_35, 320x480 SPI)
- Linux simulator with V4L2 webcam support for QR scanning and entropy capture
- PMIC support (AXP2101) with battery level indicator and power-off
- Camera settings overlay with adjustable exposure, focus, and autofocus controls
- Persistent camera AE target and focus position (NVS)
- CI jobs for automated builds
- BIP32 derivation path parser tests

### Changed
- Upgraded camera resolution to 1280x960
- Improved QR decoder performance; max QR version raised to 25
- Migrated wave_4b BSP to esp_lv_adapter and trimmed display API
- Bumped ESP-IDF to early 6.1 with relevant bugfixes
- Gated dev tools behind build configuration
- Addresses page: replaced Receive/Change toggle with dropdown
- Added processing dialog during PSBT signing
- Larger button surfaces on UI

### Fixed
- QR alignment pattern detection: use centroid instead of region seed
- BIP32 derivation path parsing
- Dialog titles better fit within bounds
- Watchdog timeout increased to accommodate PIN PBKDF2 processing
- Simulator PIN behavior aligned with device
- Correct BTN_COUNT macro calculation in keyboard

## [0.0.2]

### Added
- OTA-ready partition table (factory + dual OTA slots, 16MB flash)
- Message signing (prove address ownership)
- Smart Scanner: unified scan on home page handles PSBTs, messages, addresses, descriptors, and mnemonics
- Display rotation setting (0/90/180/270) with PPA hardware counter-rotation for camera
- PPA-accelerated bilinear downscaling for QR decoding
- Blue Wallet multisig descriptor parsing

### Changed
